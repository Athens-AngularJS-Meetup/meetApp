Of course AngularJS is the leader to create and structure responsive applications, SPA and realtime interfaces no matter which language we use for the backend (php5, nodeJS, ruby etc). Many other players try to make some impression like ReactJS, EmberJS so a modern developer has to keep learning and modernising his/her skills. This group is created for guys who really want to follow latest web development techniques and love javascript.

It will run all year round on the last Wednesday evening of each month (more or less). For this season\u2019s events, we have chosen two of our favourite winter venues \u2013 Mikro Kosmo, Singrou Fix/ Asty, Petit Palais for worldwide cinema productions and Theater Neou Kosmou (which often has a choice of several interesting productions from writers around the world). Both venues have cosy bar areas to give us time to meet and greet each other before performances and during intervals. After the film/theatre production, those who wish to, can stay behind to share views on what we have seen. We will post details of meet up time plus film/show we are going to see around ten days beforehand. In the case of our theatre months (November, January and March), this will give you time to book and reserve your seat. If you are interested, let\u2019s get together. We hope you\u2019ll join this group, and we look forward to seeing you soon at one of the events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Η ομάδα μας απευθύνεται στους λάτρεις του σινεμά και του θεάτρου. Στόχος μας είναι να καθιερώσουμε συναντήσεις την τελευταία Τετάρτη κάθε μήνα. Για τις συναντήσεις αυτής της χρονιάς επιλέξαμε και προτείνουμε δύο από τους αγαπημένους μας χώρους: το σινεμά Μικρόκοσμο (στάση μετρό Fix \u2013 Συγγρού), Το Άστυ (Κοραή), το Πτι Παλαί (Ριζάρη) όπου προβάλλονται ενδιαφέρουσες διεθνείς κινηματογραφικές παραγωγές, και τη θεατρική σκηνή του Νέου Kόσμου που προσφέρει περισσότερες ενδιαφέρουσες επιλογές και θεατρικές παραγωγές κάθε χρονιά. Και οι δύο χώροι βρίσκονται σε κεντρικό σημείο, διαθέτουν ευχάριστο καφέ- μπαρ όπου μπορούμε να συναντηθούμε και να μιλήσουμε πριν, κατά τα διαλείμματα και μετά την παράσταση. Μετά την παράσταση, όσοι θέλουν, μπορούν να ανταλλάξουν απόψεις και να συνεχίσουν την κουβέντα . Θα δημοσιεύσουμε στοιχεία των παραστάσεων και σημείου συνάντησης δέκα ημέρες πριν από κάθε εκδήλωση. Τους μήνες των θεατρικών μας συναντήσεων, θα έχουμε έτσι το χρόνο να κλείσουμε τα εισιτήριά μας και να κρατήσουμε θέση εγκαίρως. Αν αγαπάτε το σινεμά και το θέατρο και την κουβέντα όπως και εμείς, ελάτε να συναντηθούμε στη νέα μας ομάδα. Ελπίζουμε να τα πούμε σύντομα από κοντά στις εκδηλώσεις μας.</p>","created":1412612309000,"city":"Athens","country":"GR","state":"","join_mode":"open","visibility":"public","lat":37.97999954223633,"lon":23.729999542236328,"members":236,"organizer":{"id":152329402,"name":"VASSILIKI GEORGANTA","bio":""},"who":"Cinema and Theater Lovers","group_photo":{"id":437391525,"highres_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/4/5/highres_437391525.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/4/5/600_437391525.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/4/5/thumb_437391525.jpeg"},"timezone":"Europe/Athens","category":{"id":20,"name":"Movies & Film","shortname":"Films"},"photos":[{"id":433834666,"highres_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/6/a/highres_433834666.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/6/a/600_433834666.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/6/a/thumb_433834666.jpeg"},{"id":433834684,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/7/c/highres_433834684.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/7/c/600_433834684.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/7/c/thumb_433834684.jpeg"},{"id":433834706,"highres_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/9/2/highres_433834706.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/9/2/600_433834706.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/9/2/thumb_433834706.jpeg"},{"id":433834721,"highres_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/a/1/highres_433834721.jpeg","photo_link":"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/a/1/600_433834721.jpeg","thumb_link":"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/a/1/thumb_433834721.jpeg"}]},{"score":1.0,"id":18391734,"name":"Project Management - Building the World","link":"http://www.meetup.com/Project-Management-Meetup-Building-the-World/","urlname":"Project-Management-Meetup-Building-the-World","description":"<p><span>This Group is about Project Management and Project Managers, <br>methodologies, bets practices, tools, roles, programs, portfolios and <br>networking. <br> <br>Audience: Project/Program/Portfolio Managers, Team Leaders, PMOs, senior developers and business managers. <br> <br>Why to Join: For networking, to learn from formal workshops and from our <br>shares experiences, for participating in discussion on recent trends, tools <br>and best practices. <br></span></p>\n<p><span>Organizer: TheCube, Open Support Grid&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Coordinator: Spyros Ktenas, IT/Business/Social Project Manager, tools author, hobbyist developer, article writer, more than 100 successful projects.
